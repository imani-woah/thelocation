            <p>I really liked this talk. I thought Chimero walked the reader through his thoughts in a very meandering journey that wrapped up nicely. I found the study about which apps people regretted absolutely fascinating!! The majority of the most regretted apps being social apps that people spent hours on was incredible. I thought Chimero’s observation was correct, they were typically apps that you open when you’re bored or doomscrolling, then mindlessly use for hours and hours. I know my stats would be similar—I usually hate the time I spend aimlessly scrolling through instagram reels, but it feels like it’s never finished (which I know is their goal). I never feel “full” or stimulated properly in a way that makes me say “Okay, I’m done now!” like how someone can easily read a chapter of a book and then go to bed. I also liked the discussion of websites as a pleasant, non-commercial third space.</p>
