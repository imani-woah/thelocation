            <p>I found this really interesting! I loved his reasonings for calling a website handmade—the feelings of small, everyday sites made by anyone. I also love the experimental and weird websites that people make, like the Unindexed project which deleted itself after 22 days! I’m tempted to use the source code and see how long it takes nowadays. I love when websites are treated like art pieces, and I think handmade, imperfect sites are perfect examples of that. Viewing coding as artistic and allowing it to be unfinished and ever-changing is really great for me, since part of the reason I always give up on coding is that it is so overwhelming. It feels like it needs to be perfectly polished if you even DARE to publish it. So hearing about wacky, handmade, fun sites is really great for me!</p>
