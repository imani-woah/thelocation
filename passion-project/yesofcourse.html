        <p>Of course you do. Who doesn't?</p>
        <p>And of course you want to know what these shows are, now that I've been hyping them up!</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Better Call Saul</li>
            <li>Breaking Bad</li>
            <li>You (The Netflix show... but specifically season three) </li>
            <li>It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</li>
            <li>The Office</li>
            <li>Under The Banner of Heaven</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Aren't all of those equally good AND incredibly comforting?</p>
        <p>Idk I just think all genres work as comfort shows!!</p>
        <p>Comedies are a given! Who amongst us has not uttered a quote from The Office? Who hath not laid their eyes upon a meme from IASIP? But I think dramas also work really well (especially long ones). Like yeah I know the plot of Breaking Bad because I've watched it one billion times, but I still like seeing the journey!! I still like falling in love with these characters! I still like hoping that this time, it'll be different!! And of course it never is, but that's okay too, because I can watch it again and 


        <h1>WOWOWWWOWOWOWOWOW THAT WAS A LOT OF YAPPING!!</h1>
